**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This app provide dynamic, filtered searches of a UFO sightings database using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

See it live here: 


**REPOSITORY NAVIGATION**

There are 2 versions: "Level 1" filters based on data only, while "Level 2" filters based on 5 criteria. Information on Level 2 is available here: 
* [*Index file with HTML code*](https://github.com/kennethcandersen/javascript-challenge/blob/main/UFO-level-2/index.html) sets up the app's structure online. 
* [*JS file with Javascript code*](https://github.com/kennethcandersen/javascript-challenge/blob/main/UFO-level-2/static/js/app.js). 
* [*Stylesheet with CSS code*](https://github.com/kennethcandersen/javascript-challenge/commit/cb4d4ef464f24286c4c3ea6e73317deac3e9eb9f). The app uses relies mostly on Bootstrap CSS, with some customized elements in this file. 

**OBJECTIVE**

Create an app that allows users to dynamically filter UFO sighting data by data, city, state, country and shape. 


**STEPS, TOOLS & LANGUAGES USED**

1. Create the structure in HTML. Some starter code was provided, but the filter function was written for this project.
2. Create and test the JS file that does the following:
3. Imports data from a JSON file. 
4. Converts the data into a table that is automatically inserted into the HTML code of the index.html file when it loads into a browser.
5. Finds unique values for each column the dataset and automatically creates arrays which become the pulldown menu items for the filter buttons. 
6. Creates event handlers to trigger functions when the filter buttons are used.
7. 
8. Convert the scraping code created in Notebook into one Python file as a function that can be called by the app. 
9. Create the app in a Python file using Flask that calls the scraping function, pulls the results from the Mongo database, and launches the HTML page that renders the data (see next item).
10. Create an HTML file with Bootstrap and CSS that renders the data in a convenient user interface.
